## Troubleshooting

### SQL Terminal Not Showing Queries
1. Check that SQL Debug context is enabled
2. Verify backend middleware is active
3. Check browser console for errors

### Analytics Endpoints Returning Errors
1. Verify database has sample data
2. Check Django logs for SQL errors
3. Ensure all migrations are applied: `python manage.py migrate`

### Trending Songs Not Appearing
1. Verify songs exist with recent activity (last 7 days)
2. Check browser Network tab for API response
3. Verify endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/analytics/songs/trending/`

### Search Filters Not Working
1. Check that advanced search endpoint is being called
2. Verify filter values are being sent in POST body
3. Check SQL Terminal for query with filters

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… **You have successfully demonstrated all SQL concepts when:**

1. SQL Terminal shows queries from all 11 concept categories
2. All analytics tabs display data without errors
3. Dashboard shows trending songs with rankings
4. Search works with all filter combinations
5. CRUD operations visible in SQL Terminal
6. No TypeScript or Python errors in consoles
7. SQL concept badges appear correctly in terminal
8. All checkboxes in this guide are marked complete

---

## Additional Notes

### For Course Evaluation
- **Screenshot Evidence**: Capture SQL Terminal showing different query types
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Show all 5 tabs with data
- **Trending Section**: Demonstrate date-based filtering
- **Search Filters**: Show IN, LIKE, BETWEEN usage
- **Code Review**: Point to analytics.py for SQL implementations

### SQL Concepts Documentation
Each analytics endpoint documents which SQL concepts it demonstrates:
- See `harmonydb-backend/songs/analytics.py` for implementation details
- See `harmonydb-backend/songs/urls_analytics.py` for endpoint mapping
- See `AI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for comprehensive overview

---

## Quick Test Commands

### Backend Health Check
```bash
# Test analytics endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/analytics/songs/statistics/
curl http://localhost:8000/api/analytics/artists/top/
curl http://localhost:8000/api/analytics/songs/trending/
```

### Database Query Check
```bash
# Django shell
python manage.py shell

# Test analytics functions
from songs.analytics import SongAnalytics
analytics = SongAnalytics()
print(analytics.get_song_statistics())
```

## Conclusion

This guide ensures comprehensive testing of all SQL concepts implemented in HarmonyDB. Follow the checklist systematically, monitor the SQL Terminal, and verify that all query types are properly classified and displayed.

**Remember**: The goal is to demonstrate mastery of SQL concepts through a real-world application with proper architecture and best practices! ðŸŽ¯
